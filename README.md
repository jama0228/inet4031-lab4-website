# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Instructions, files, code for Lab 6.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the work completed for Lab 2 in the Inet4031 course, which focuses on web development fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project involves creating a simple interactive webpage that demonstrates the use of these technologies in a practical, hands-on way. The primary feature of the webpage is a lightbulb that can be toggled on and off through a button, showcasing basic JavaScript functionality. The repository also serves as a learning tool for version control using Git and GitHub, as well as best practices for organizing and formatting a web project. By working on this repository, I gained experience in building web pages, integrating interactivity, and managing a project through GitHub.
